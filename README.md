Apache Storm Tutorial Draft

We decided to split the group in three sub-groups:

- Introduction, conclusion and support:
this sub-group is composed by Lorenzo and Davide. Their goal is to give a simple and intuitive presentation of Apache Storm together with assistance on the installation step. Moreover they will cover the presentation of the homework.

- Basic example:
this sub-group is composed by Federico and Riccardo. Their goal is to provide a simple example of usage, explaining how to implement each single component and how to make them interact.

- Advanced example:
this sub-group is composed by Roberto and Sara. They will show how to integrate external services like Twitter on top of a Storm project. This will also include Trident which is a high-level abstraction for doing realtime computing on top of Storm.
